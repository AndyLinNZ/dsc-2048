# DSC Flutter Workshop - 2048 Game App

## Introduction

Welcome to our final project for DSC Unimelb's flutter workshop series! This project will be split into two workshops.

Part 1 - Game logic design in dart. (Presented in Workshop 5, Week 9)

Part 2 - Integrating the game with Flutter. (Presented in Workshop 6, Week 11)

A few resources that may be helpful along the way:

- [Stack Widgets](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Stack-class.html)

- [GestureDetector](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/GestureDetector-class.html)
- [MediaQueryData](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/MediaQueryData-class.html)

The idea of this workshop is to provide you a step by step guide on how to develop the 2048 game app from start to finish.
We will also be recording and presenting a live workshop where you can follow along if there are any questions. Please check out our [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKouuSTvFtFm_uR4QtKVx0g) for the recording.
