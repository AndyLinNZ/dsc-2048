## Introduction

Welcome to our final project for DSC Unimelb's flutter workshop series! This project will be split into two workshops.

Part 1 - Game logic design in dart. (Presented in Workshop 5, Week 9, presented by Aarnav and Andy)

Part 2 - Integrating the game with Flutter. (Presented in Workshop 6, Week 10 during mid sem break, presented by Aarnav and Andy)

A few resources that may be helpful along the way:

- [Opacity Widgets](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Opacity-class.html)
- [GestureDetector widgets](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/GestureDetector-class.html)
- [MediaQueryData widgets](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/MediaQueryData-class.html)

The idea of this repository is to provide you a step by step guide on how to develop the 2048 game app from start to finish.
We will also be recording and presenting live workshops where you can follow along if there are any questions. Please check out our [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKouuSTvFtFm_uR4QtKVx0g) for the recordings.
